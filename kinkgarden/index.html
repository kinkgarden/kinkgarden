<h4>what is this?</h4>
<p>kink.garden is a project that aims to create a website where you can make a <b>list of your kinks</b> that you can
    share with friends, the world, or no one but yourself!</p>
<p>this project was started and conceptualized <b>by queer people, for queer people.</b> it is being built from the
    ground up to be queer-inclusive, always with respectfulness in mind. you won't have to worry about bigotry,
    objectifying slurs, or tastelessly fetishizing marginalized people.</p>
